# Analysis-on-real-time-student-survey-data
In this project, I am going to work on survey data which was conducted as part of my college course project.
I worked along with my friends on this student survey data.

The survey data contains a lot of questions about students. For example, their Physical activities(Gym, Athletics, Sports), music preferences, social media activity details, video game activities, mobile screen time, time spent on studies, GPA, etc. 

I along with my friends have worked on finding the correlation between student's physical activities and academic performance. 

- Step 1: Out of all the features, we hand-picked the necessary columns that are required for our analysis. 
- Step 2: Performed data cleaning 
- Step 3: Performed data analysis
- Step 4: Hypothesis Testing
 * GPA depends on the physical activity of a student.
* Students' frequency of going to the gym depends on stress levels.
* GPA depends on the time spent on studies.
* GPA depends on who is stressed (to handle sports and studies)
